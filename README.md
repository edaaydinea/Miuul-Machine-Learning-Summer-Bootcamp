# Miuul Machine Learning Summer Bootcamp
This repo includes projects and assignments made within the Machine Learning Summer Bootcamp.

### Program objectives
The free summer camp, which will be organized for undergraduate or graduate students without any income, will be held with the hybrid education model of Miuul. All the development stages of a machine learning project will be explained in this camp, where participants will be provided with the support of mentors who have experience in different national and international companies, as well as access to the materials to be presented within the scope of the learning process.
